# portfolio
first front-end project, also my portfolio (constantly updated)

I'm using HTML, CSS and VanillaJS in this project, but in the future i'll be creating a new one, using React too.

All the content here was made by using only pure CSS and VanillaJS. The ideia is not to use any kind of framework or library, just practice my skills in coding from scratch
